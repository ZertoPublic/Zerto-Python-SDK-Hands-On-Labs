# Exercise 6: Failover Testing

## Overview
In this exercise, you'll learn how to perform and manage failover tests for your VPGs. You'll understand the testing process and how to monitor test status.

## Objectives
- Initiate failover tests
- Monitor test status
- Stop running tests
- Handle test results

## Time
10 minutes

## Prerequisites

- Access to test resources

## Exercise Steps
1. Select a VPG for testing
2. Initiate a failover test
3. Monitor test progress
4. Stop the test
5. Review test results
