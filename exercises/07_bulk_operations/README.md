# Exercise 7: Bulk Operations

## Overview
This final exercise covers bulk operations, focusing on managing multiple VMs efficiently. You'll learn how to perform operations on multiple VMs simultaneously.

## Objectives
- Perform bulk IP modifications
- Manage multiple VMs
- Handle bulk operations efficiently
- Monitor bulk task progress

## Time
5 minutes

## Prerequisites
- Completed Exercise 6
- Working VPGs with multiple VMs
- Access to VM management

## Exercise Steps
1. Prepare VM list
2. Configure bulk operations
3. Execute bulk IP changes
4. Monitor operation progress
5. Verify changes

## Working Directory
The `working` directory contains:
- `bulk_ip.py` - Template to complete
- `vm_list.csv` - Sample VM list

## Solution
The `solution` directory contains:
- `bulk_ip.py` - Complete working example
- `vm_list.csv` - Example VM list

## Key Concepts
- Bulk operations
- IP management
- Task monitoring
- Error handling

## Common Issues
- Invalid IP configurations
- Operation timeouts
- Partial failures
- Resource constraints
