Exercise 2: Authentication - Beginner-Friendly Instructions
This script demonstrates how to authenticate with Zerto API using Keycloak.

Prerequisites:
1. Install the zvml package in development mode:
   cd /path/to/zvml-python-sdk
   pip install -e .
2. Update prerequisites/config.py with your ZVM details

3. Update prerequisites/config.py with your ZVM details:
   - ZVM_HOST: Your Zerto Virtual Manager IP address or hostname
   - CLIENT_ID: Your Keycloak client ID
   - CLIENT_SECRET: Your Keycloak client secret

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
In this exercise, you will:
1. Create a ZVMLClient object to connect to your ZVM
2. Test the connection by getting information about your local site
3. Handle any errors that might occur

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Look at the TODO comments below - they tell you exactly what to do
2. Replace the placeholder code with the actual code
3. Each step has hints and examples to help you
4. If you get stuck, check the solution file in the solution/ directory

WHAT IS A ZVMLClient?
- It's like a "remote control" for your Zerto Virtual Manager
- It handles all the communication with your ZVM
- You need to give it your ZVM address and login credentials
