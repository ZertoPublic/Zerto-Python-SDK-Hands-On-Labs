## Overview
This exercise focuses on discovering and working with resources in your Zerto environment. You'll learn how to find VMs in your local site and discover various resources (datastores, hosts, folders, networks) in peer sites.

## Objectives
- Discover local site VMs
- Work with peer site resources:
  - Datastores
  - Hosts
  - Folders
  - Networks
- Handle site identifiers properly
- Use JSON for data display

## Time
15 minutes

## Prerequisites
- Completed Exercise 3 (Site Discovery)
- Working site discovery
- Access to site resources
